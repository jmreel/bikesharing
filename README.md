# Bike Sharing Program

## Project Overview
After seeing the success for Citi Bike in New York City, our team wanted to expand Citi Bike to Des Moines Iowa. By using Tableau, our team will create effective visualization from the Citi Bike data. Through this project we will focus on checkout times and trips. We will expand on these data sets by comparing checkout times for users and by genders, and we will also look at trips by weekday and trips by gender. 

## Results
Checkout times show that most users use the Citi Bikes for 5 minutes and their time quickly drops after (figure 1). When analyzing this same information but filtering by Gender there are similar results. The large difference is that the users are dominated by males peaking at 108,087 males, while females peak at 34,151. 

We can also see a trend that most users choose to take a trip on the weekend between 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM, while on the weekdays they take a trip between 7:00 AM-9:00 AM and 4:00 PM-7:00 PM (figure 3). When we filter by gender, we are shown similar results but with less users (figure 4). Finally, if we look at “User Trips by Gender by Weekday” we can see that a large amount of the users come from subscribers (figure 5).

## Summary
In summary we can see multiple trends when analyzing the data: checkout times, trip start time, and trips taken during the week. The data shows that most of the users are male. While most of the users are male, both male and female have similar tendencies. Their checkout times and trips taken during the week mimic each other. Finally, most of their users come from subscribers.
